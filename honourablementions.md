# Honourable mentions
We couldn't have made this website without a boatload of resources.
Of course resources used in seperate projects are mentioned in their respective pages, but for the page itself:

- [the hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
- [basic git manual](https://git-scm.com/)
- [how to markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
